# express-api-boilerplate

Boilerplate for an API written in Express, based on some previous projects. It includes:

- Documentation and examples on how to use this boilerplate
  effectively
- Full ES6/ES7 support via Babel/Babel Polyfill.
- Code to force using SSL on production servers (your job to get
  the proper certs, I suggest getting free ones using
  [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/))
- Some basic code for creating and validating JSON web tokens
- Jest testing, and Prettier/ESLint linting already set up, with
  NPM scripts to invoke them.
- Automatic code reloading when code changes
- Debugger configuration
